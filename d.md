   **Coronavirus** is a family of viruses that can cause illness, which can vary from _common cold_ and _cough_ to sometimes more severe disease. **Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)** and **Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)** were such severe cases with the world already has faced.  
**SARS-CoV-2 (n-coronavirus)** is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first _discovered_ in 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. It is a _contiguous_ virus which started from **Wuhan** in **December 2019**. Which later declared as **Pandemic** by **WHO** due to high rate spreads throughout the world. Currently (on the date 10 June 2020), this leads to a total of _500K+ Deaths_ across the globe.  
Pandemic is spreading all over the world; it becomes more important to understand about this spread. This NoteBook is an effort to analyze the cumulative data of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases over time. In this notebook, the main focus is to analyze the spread trend of this virus all over the world.
